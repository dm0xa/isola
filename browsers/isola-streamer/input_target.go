// CDP input binds to exactly one page target — the active tab (see startTabCtrl
// in tabs.go). Video does not follow that binding: frames come from the Electron
// window's offscreen producer, which always shows the active tab. So when the
// input binding goes stale the viewer gets a live, normal-looking page whose
// mouse and keyboard do nothing, and the only repair used to be the user
// switching tabs by hand, because a tab switch is the one event that re-points
// the binding.
//
// Two ways the binding goes stale on its own:
//
//   - The active tab navigates. Its id does not change, so no tab switch is
//     reported, and preferredURL keeps the URL the tab had at switch time. A
//     later CDP reconnect then matches nothing and falls through to connect()'s
//     fallback: the first non-blank page target in /json/list, which in a
//     multi-tab session is usually a background tab.
//   - A reconnect happens while connect()'s 1.5 s preferred-target window has
//     expired, with the same fallback outcome.
//
// Both leave input aimed at the wrong page for the rest of the session — until
// the user tabs away and back. This watchdog closes that gap by re-aligning the
// binding with the active tab, so input recovers on its own within a tick.

// inputTargetCheckInterval is the re-alignment period. A tick costs one string
// comparison unless the binding is actually wrong.

// is the case where input may genuinely be bound to a different tab of the same
